# Strive Math Take Home Test

## IMPORTANT

- To run the app follow these steps:
- git clone
- npm install
- npm run dev
- open in brower: localhost:3000

Node version is v18.15.0

### Challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all lessons from the Airtable Base
- Go through different slides per lesson

### Improvements

- There are a few improvements to be done majorly around styling sections & components.
- The code section on the slides still needs improvements, and I had a challenge for formatting multiple code sections, but I am studing the react-markdown library for a better fix for future scenarios.
- This took me about 5 hours 48 minutes split in intervals within 24 hours.
- I spent a lot of time familiarizing my self with the Project Directory, understanding all instructions.

### Built with:

- NextJS
- TypeScript
- Airtable API
- Daisy UI
- React Markdown
- Zustand
